                  2.Economics-Children are entitled to a free, quality basic education. Recognizing this entitlement, world leaders made the achievement of universal primary education by the year 2015 one of the Millennium Development Goals. In 2004, this goal appears to be out of reach for many poor countries. School attendance, especially for girls, is far from universal, and many children drop out of school before completing their primary education. Many children who do attend school receive an inadequate education because of poorly trained, underpaid teachers, overcrowded classrooms, and a lack of basic teaching tools such as textbooks, blackboards, and pens and paper.
             <br></br>
             3. Productivity/Efficiency-Being productive' or 'being efficient' is a vital aspect of a student's being. It means that students have to be the most efficient if they wish to reach their goals. If students are productive then they are efficient enough to meet the challenges and tasks that are needed to achieve their goals and aspirations
